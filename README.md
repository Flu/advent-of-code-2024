# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## About

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. Advent of Code is a yearly programming event featuring 25 days of puzzles, each with two parts. It's a fun way to improve problem-solving skills, explore algorithms, and enjoy the holiday spirit!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific day of the challenge. Each day's folder contains:

- **`part1.py`**: Python script for solving Part 1 of the day's puzzle.
- **`part2.py`**: Python script for solving Part 2 of the day's puzzle.
- **`test.txt`**: Example input provided in the puzzle description.
- **`input.txt`**: Personalized input specific to my Advent of Code account.

## Why I Made This Repo

- To participate in Advent of Code 2024 and enhance my programming skills.
- To document my progress and solutions in an organized manner.
- To preserver this code for future generations to laught at.
- I could have made this repository funnier for them if I wrote it in Javascript.
- I fucking hate javascript.

Solutions prioritize readability and problem-solving, so performance optimization may vary.
